# React Native app test

> Application test for the [OpenClassRooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4902061-developpez-une-application-mobile-react-native?status=published) course

Not exactly the same as course (some depreciations like Navigation)


## Todo
- [ ] Add PanResponder to the Share button to move it
- [x] Global loading component
    - [ ] Fix styles as props (see here)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29363671/can-i-make-dynamic-styles-in-react-native]
